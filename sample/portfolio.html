                “Fresh From the Vine”

North-easterners send their kids to sleep-away camps in Maine, striving to help their children understand the importance of stepping outside of their hometown bubbles.  Maine, however, makes that quite difficult due to its many similarities to the summer vacation favorite: The Hamptons. Subconsciously, many parents choose camps in Maine, knowing their kids won’t feel uncomfortable.  On the way to the Hamptons, it is likely to pass local fruit stands and fruit-picking farms.  In fact, this is one of the main attractions that draws in thousands of visitors each summer.  For only a few dollars, most farms will grant you full access to the endless amount of fresh fruit growing outside.  My mom and I always sneak a taste before bringing our baskets of fruit back to our hungry family.
  </p><p>
From Portland to the Augusta area and beyond, there is a surplus of fruit and vegetable farms available to the public.  The history of why blueberries are Maine’s native berry roots back centuries to Maine’s Native Americans.  Originally, the berries were used for their healing qualities, but they were eventually commercially harvested in the 1840s.  The growth of wild blueberries has adapted to Maine’s challenging winters and currently stretch along 44,000 acres of fields and barrens.  As a camper, we would venture out to the blueberry farms for a day trip.  I remember looking down at my blueberry stained fingers and feeling accomplished at the many baskets I had filled.  We would bring the fresh fruit to the camp’s kitchen, and the next day stacks of blueberry pancakes would appear in the dining hall.  My friends and I agreed, those were the most satisfying  pancakes we ate the entire summer.

“The Dirt Road that Turned to Gravel”
  </p><p>
“Stop the car,” I grunted to my parents from the backseat.  I was driving to the Camp Vega bus-stop, and a wave of nausea rushed over my body.  I don’t know if it was nerves, excitement, or the thought of consuming all of the candy I brought along with me, but I couldn’t bear to sit still.  This feeling quickly changed once I marched onto the bus with my potential best friends and started chanting the camp cheers we effortlessly learned and memorized already.  The landmark that confirmed that camp was approaching was the famous dirt road.  Although ugly to strangers, to a camper it was the most beautiful road ever traveled on.  As I grew older, this dirt road was upgraded to gravel.  This renovation did not change the magical 20 minutes spent driving over it, though; the surge of adrenaline was always the same.  I frequently seemed to flashback to my summers in the Hamptons with my family.  The landmarks and the environment all blended into one, and the feeling of home comforted me.  The bus-ride reminded me of my car rides to the Hamptons which included stops to Tate’s Bake Shop.  My dad and brother would always get the fluffy, cinnamon coffee cake, while my mom and I stuck to their famous chocolate chip cookies. I looked down at my pack of Oreos and imagined I was back in Southhampton.  The crisp air hit my face as I rolled down the window, the care-free people strolled the sidewalks, the homemade ice-cream shops and antique stores stuck out on every corner, and most importantly, the irreplaceable feeling of relaxation was there.  Fayette, Maine was my second home, and when the two months of camp passed, the thought of the Hamptons back at home made the goodbye a lot less difficult.  I always thought how lucky I was to be introduced to Maine and how my school friends, who went to camp in upstate New York and Pennsylvania, were missing out.

“Homemade Ice Cream, Lobster Rolls, Galore!”
  </p><p>
If you were to ask anyone in Fayette, Maine where they wanted to break their diet, they would say “Tubby’s.”  “Tubby’s Ice Cream” has two locations in Maine, and both are equally as delicious.  There are over 20 different flavors creatively painted on wooden slabs practically yelling at you to pick them.  When asked to try a flavor, you are handed a miniature cone, dipped in chocolate with rainbow sprinkles, spilling over with a large scoop of ice cream.  It’s difficult to not stand there all day taste testing all of the unique flavors.  Flavors range from burnt caramel to black licorice to peppermint stick.  Even their simple flavors such as strawberry and chocolate cannot compare to any other ice cream because they are made with the freshest, locally grown ingredients.  Ice cream is not the only shining star at this shop, though.  Tubby’s is famous for their massive lobster rolls.  Buttered brioche rolls overflow with chunks of lobster meat, and locals can agree that Maine lobster cannot be beat.  Visitors wash all of this food down with their local blueberry soda that is nearly impossible to find elsewhere.
  </p><p>
Aside from its scenic beaches, the Hamptons is famous for their local ice cream shops and lobster roll stands.  East Hampton is known for its high-end stores, pricey restaurants, and luxury homes.  It’s hard to imagine a quaint ice cream parlor would belong there, but “Scoop Du Jour” attracts crowds large enough to create lines that lead outside.  Many will agree that on a hot day in the Hamptons, ice cream is a necessity.  The flavors are not as adventurous as Tubby’s, but there is absolutely something for everyone.  Skimming over the board of flavors posted on the wall can be overwhelming, but it’s hard to make a bad choice.  There are lobster roll spots all over the Hamptons, but the best of the best stand in Montauk.  At “Gosman’s Clam Bar,” visitors flock for the massive, delectable lobster rolls, but they stay for the view.  The shack is conveniently located on the water, and like Tubby’s, the food comes out within minutes, leaving time to find the table with the best view.  Their lobster rolls are best enjoyed with a glass of wine from Wolffer Estate, a local winery in Sagaponack.

“The Ultimate Getaway”
  </p><p>
As I sat down on the sticky wooden bench in the dining hall, I heard my favorite sentence shouted through a megaphone: “It’s a waterfront afternoon!”  Adrenaline rushed through my body, and it felt as if I was just told I won the lottery.  My best friends and I unstuck our forest green Soffee shorts from our seats, ran through the grey gravel to our bunks, and raced to put on our TYR one-pieces, grab our afternoon snack from the counselor, and dive into the warm lake.  Even at the age of 15, being in the oldest age-group, the feeling of the water underneath me never failed to bring me back to my first year of camp.  It was something about how the artificial cherry-flavored snow cone tasted, how the temperature of the water always seemed to be just right, and how the sound of my best friends’ laughter seemed to put me at ease, no matter what mood I was in.  I thought to myself how fortunate I was to have the luxury of facing new experiences and tackling the most complicated years of my life with the girls that meant the most to me.  When I closed my eyes, the breeze lifted the wet strands of hair off my back, and I imagined I was sitting on a towel on the beach in the Hamptons.  Though different states, the feeling of complete bliss was the same.  There are moments when all of my worries seem meaningless, and this was one of them.

“Funtown, Spashtown, USA!”
  </p><p>
If you are looking for a thrilling experience while vacationing in Maine, “Funtown Splashtown USA” is the perfect spot to visit.  Every corner you turn, there are upside down rollercoasters, food stands, and water slides to try out.  This amusement park is split into two sections.  The rides at Funtown range from bumper cars to the flying trapeze, but the rollercoasters are the most exhilarating.  The Excalibur is a famed wooden rollercoaster that holds the record for the tallest and largest coaster in not only Maine’s history but in all of Northern New England.  In fact, it is the only wooden rollercoaster in Maine.  While you wait in line, you can hear the coaster creak as it turns each corner and cries for help from those brave enough to experience the ride.  This does not stop visitors from waiting on hour long lines just to experience the rush of this ride and leave with priceless photos depicting shocked facial expressions.  Splashtown is a water park filled with waterslides and log flumes.  The “Tornado” is the only family raft slide in Northern New England.  This slide is painted green with bright orange blocks covering it.  Once you jump onto the raft, you will be launched into a steep, bendy tube that empties into a massive hole.  As you whirlwind around the hole, you are propelled into the water.  This is the kind of slide you beg your parents to go on with you again and again until you feel sick.  Luckily, the park contains a variety of food options to help gain back those calories you’ve worked off from running around all day.  If you look around, you will see multiple stands with signs labeled “Fried Dough.”  Fried dough is a treat you can only indulge in once a year, but every bite is worth it.  A paper plate is completely covered by an enormous slab of fried dough, and it is typically covered in powdered sugar or cinnamon.  As you take a bite, the crispy dough makes a crunch noise, and the powdered sugar coats your tongue.  It is definitely a sweet ending to an action-packed day.

“Summer White House”
  </p><p>
Kennebunkport, Maine is home to the Bush Compound.  The Bush family has been enjoying this property for over a century.  From Bill Clinton to Vladimir Putin, many influential figures and world leaders have visited former presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush at the compound.  Although the property is gated and guarded by Secret Service officers, the main house can be seen, along with a flagpole flying the American flag. The New England shingle style home includes nine bedrooms, a four-car garage, a pool, a tennis court, a dock, and a boathouse.  Taking a stroll down Walker’s Point, where the summer home is located, makes it hard to not feel like royalty.
  </p><p>
Summertime in the Hamptons is typically filled with celebrity sightings.  It’s likely to sit down at Nick and Toni’s, a popular Italian restaurant in East Hampton, and run into Alec Baldwin or Paul McCartney.  The presence of extravagant mansions, upscale boutiques and restaurants, and a sense of privacy makes this destination a perfect getaway for A-listers.
  </p><p>
“Murder Mysteries”
  </p><p>
Maine and the Hamptons have been backdrops for movies, television shows, and novels for many years.  Stephen King has proven that Maine is not always so glamorous and tranquil.  Driving through the fog on a Winter morning creates a mystical, mysterious atmosphere.  It’s easy to feel lonely and scared as grey clouds gather and not a single soul can be seen.  Abandoned buildings, cemeteries, and still waters seem to be the only thing in sight even when it’s dark out.  The summer vacation destination quickly changes to a spooky setting as soon as the seasons change.  “Carrie” by Stephen King, for example, is about a disturbed, bullied girl who creates disaster in her hometown of Chamberlain, Maine.  The mystifying nature of Maine causes each scene to become more horrifying.
  </p><p>
“The Affair,” a television series on Showtime, highlights death, murder, and betrayal, and its main backdrop is the Hamptons.  There’s something about the small-town feel and the quietness that makes each event seem creepier.  Every movie or show to take place in the Hamptons is not terrifying, though.  Characters on “Gossip Girl” and “Sex and the City” frequent the Hamptons during the summertime.  They utilize the Hamptons to take a break from their drama-filled lives.  The sense of privacy is used for inspiration and relaxation instead of for thrilling events.
